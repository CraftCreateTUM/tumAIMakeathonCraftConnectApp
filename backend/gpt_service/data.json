    "jobdescription": "I met with the customer and did the safety orientation. Then I changed 86 hydraulic hoses. I removed the applicator and doctor roll, and replaced the old ledge MF glue unit with a new one. I painted the glue unit pan. I finished the applicator and doctor roll change without any issues. I set the glue gap to less than 0.05 mm and calibrated the voltage to 5.1 V. I calibrated the glue applicator gap to 0.004 cold for cassettes C, B, and E. I set up the flags at the center position. I rebuilt the lifting spindles on both sides. I fixed some hydraulic problems with the glue unit, such as pressure balt, control valve o-rings, and proxy switch. I removed the old lifting spindles and installed new ones with new accessories. I removed and polished the stainless steel pan at the bottom of the glue unit. I cleaned up the bottom of the glue unit and saw that it was very rusty and had lost about 8 mm of material. I prepared and installed new rolls and accessories in the MF glue unit. I replaced the lifting spindles and set them to 1 mm protrusion at minimum. I set the flags to red box with this 1 mm. I paralleled the glue gap. I monitored the production of cassettes C, B, and E.\n",
