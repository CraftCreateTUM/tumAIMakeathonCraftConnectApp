To run, you need the following two environment variables:

SPEECH_BACKEND_IP_ADDRESS (ask Christopher for it)
LOCAL_FILE_PATH= (the path where your audio file is located, e.g. /Users/chris/Desktop/frontend_file.webm)

With those, you can then run the client_test.sh script, which will send the audio file to the backend and return the text transcription.
