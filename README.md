Makeathon app - Solution for language barriers within the work industry.


Our team developed an application to facilitate connections between workers. The primary objective was to create a service that streamlines labor tracking and ensures that workers are accounted for. Our application was built using React and utilizes API calls to interface with ChatGPT for communication and English translation.

We leverage text, voice, and images to enhance the accuracy of the information. Additionally, our users have the flexibility to choose their preferred mode of communication. Upon completion, the user receives a PDF document detailing their work hours and tasks completed.
